## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating Tests from Code Selection

1. **Select code in VS Code** (e.g., a React component)
2. **Open Continue chat** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + L`)
3. **Use custom command:**
   ```
   /create-test
   
   Create tests for this login component. Include:
   - Form validation tests
   - Successful login flow
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Accessibility checks
   ```

4. **Continue will:**
   - Analyze the selected component
   - Use TestCafe MCP server to generate tests
   - Create comprehensive test files
   - Save them to your project

### Example 2: Page Analysis and Test Strategy

1. **Open Continue chat**
2. **Use the analyze command:**
   ```
   /analyze-page https://example.com/checkout
   
   I need to create tests for this checkout page. Please analyze the structure and suggest:
   - Key elements to test
   - Optimal selectors
   - Test scenarios to cover
   - Potential edge cases
   ```

3. **Continue will:**
   - Use `inspect_page` tool to analyze the URL
   - Provide detailed analysis
   - Suggest testing strategies
   - Generate initial test structure

### Example 3: Debugging Failing Tests

1. **Select failing test code**
2. **Use fix-test command:**
   ```
   /fix-test
   
   This test is flaky and fails intermittently. Help me:
   - Identify timing issues
   - Improve selector reliability
   - Add better error handling
   - Make it more stable
   ```

3. **Continue will:**
   - Analyze the test code
   - Use validation tools
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Provide updated code

### Example 4: Interactive Test Development

1. **Start a conversation:**
   ```
   I want to create end-to-end tests for my e-commerce application. Let's start with the product search and purchase flow. The site is at https://mystore.com
   ```

2. **Continue will guide you through:**
   - Page analysis and element discovery
   - Step-by-step test creation
   - Interactive browser sessions
   - Comprehensive test suite generation
